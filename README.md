# Random-DnD-Character-Creator
I couldn't decide what class/race/etc. to make my next DnD character so I made this to help

All it does is pick randomly from a list for gener, race, class. etc. after clicking the "generate" button. I wasn't trying to make anything ground breaking but there wwasn't anything online that already does the same thing without building an enitre character sheet so that's why I made this lol

This is mainly for just getting new charcter concept ideas. If you want to actually build a character you'll have to look elsewhere for that

I have added a signed exe version of the thing, for anyone who doesn't feel like downloading and compiling all of the code just for kicks.

Yeah that's about it
